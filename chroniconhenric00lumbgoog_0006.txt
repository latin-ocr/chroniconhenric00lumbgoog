Ora the 26th of J anuary 1857, the Master of the Rolls
submitted to the lheasury a proposal for the publication
ef materiale ior the History of this Oountry from tho
Invasion of the Romans to the reign of Henry VIII.

'l'he Master ol the Rolls suggested that these materiale
should be selected for publication under competent
editors without reference to periodical or chronological
arrangement, without mutilation or abridgment, prefer·
enee being given, in the first instance, to such materiale
as were most scaroc and waluable.

He proposed that each chronicle or historica] docu-
ment to be edited shordd be treated in the same way as
if the editor were engaged on an Editio Princeps3 and
for this purpose the most correct text should be formed
from an accurato collation of the best MSS.

'lo render the work more generally useful, the Master
of the Rolls suggested that the editor should giwe an
account of the MSS. employed by him, oi their age and
their pecudiarities3 that he should add to the work a
brief account of the life and times of the author, and
any remarks necessary to explain the chronology3 but
no other note or comment was to be allowed, except

what might be necessary to establish the correctness of

the text.
