INTRODUOTION.

As a full notice ol this Chronicle, aud oi the sources
from which it is edited, will be given at the comple·
tion of the text, iu the next volume, itis only ueedful
now to specify the Manuscripts which have been used.
There are but two known, both ol which are in the
British Museum among the treesures of the Cotton
collection They ere distinguished iu the notes as MS.
and A. respectively. The former, the class mark oi
which is Claudius E. ΙΙΙ., has been principally used,
not because of its superior merit, but because the other
had been seriously injured in the fire which did so
much denega to the Cottonian Library. Itis contained
in a volume oi which it forms the third portion, and in
the list os contente itis styled Hietocdu eumcum
ic regno duplice et poue cocfiuoboe per Henm'cemn
Kcightoc Leoeotreceem o Willelnw conquestore ad
Rictosrdwco 2.

The other manuscript (rh) is chased as Tiberius O. vn,
and it will be at once seen from a comparison of tho
various readings that from this Twysden's text wes
printed. Though far from being a good text, it is much
fruor from errore than the other, aud had it been uu·
injured would, os course, have been used. All thetis
readable of it has been colleted, and Twysden's edition

hes helped to melre sure of some words which otherwise
it would have been impossible to decipher. Tiberius
0. VII. is a MS. of 240 folios aud· contains nothing but
· Knighton’s Chronicle.
