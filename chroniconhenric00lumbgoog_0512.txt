On 25 J aly 1822, the chse of Commons presented an addrass to the Orown,

stating that the editions of the workscf our ancient historiens were inconvenieut
aud defective3 that many 01 their writings still remained in manuscript, and, iu
·⁸·⁰ tart? ⁸2itt:titttttfftreiltt titi· 111111111131 titt:
‘⁸ would be an undertaking honourable to His Majesty’s reign, aud couducive tc

“ therefore humbly besought His Majesty, that He would be greciousl pleased
“ tc give such directions aa His Majesty, in His wisdom, might 111101 fit, for
“ the publication 01 a complete edition cf the ancient historiens of this realm,
“ aud assured His Majesty that whatever expense might be necessary for this
‘⁴ urpcse would ba made good.’'
1110 Master 01 the Bolis, being very desircus that effect should be given to the
resolution 01 the House os Ocmmous, submitted to Her Maiesty's ibeasury in
1857 aplan 101 the publication 01 the ancient chronicles an memoriale cf the
United Kingdcm, audit was adopted accordingly. Iu selecting these works, it
was considered right, iu the first instance, 10 give preference to those cf which
the manuscripts were unique, or the materiale of which would help tc fill up
blanks in English history for which nc satisfactory aud authentia information
hitherto existed iu any accessible form. One great object the Master of the Rolls
had in view was to form a corpas taetricum within reasonable limita, and which
should be as complete aa possible. In a subject of so vast a range, it was im.
portant that the historical student should be able tc select such volumee as
conformed with hia own peculiartastesand studies, and not be put to the expense
01 purchasiug the whole collecticm an inconvenicuce inseparable freni any other
plau thau that which has beeu iu this instance adopted.
